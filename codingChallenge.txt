1.- declare function 'Question'
properties: question, answers, correct

-define variable 'q1', 'q2', 'q3'
-define variable 'questions' : question, choice array , answer number

-define variable 'questions' using array

- define variable 'n' random number make to change integer as much as question number

-declare anonymous function of 'displayQuestion' to show 'Question' using prototype : 
 print 'question' to the console
 use for loop syntax -> as much as answers.length
                     -> print 'i + ': ' + answers[i]' to the console
  
-call method: questions[n] to displayQuestion 

-declare function 'ans' which is the same as 'checkAnswer' in 'Question' using prototype :
if 'ans' is the same 'correct', print to the console
'correct answer!'
otherwise 'Wrong answer. Try again.'

-define answer : popup prompt 'Please select the correct answer.' then, use parseInt 

-call method : questions[n] to checkAnswer(answer)

-use (function() { })(); to make sure that all your code is private

---------------------------------------------

[expert level]
1. put variable questions into function 'nextQuestion' and
call it right after that
 - take defining variable questions out of the function
 - add at variable 'answer', if answer is not 'exit', then execute questions[n]checkAnswer(answer)
 - call nextQeustion for continuing
 - parseInt change its position from promt to (answer) of checkAnswer


 2.declare function 'score'
  - add variable 'sc' is the same as 0
  - return function, property-> correct
  if correct 'sc' increase, otherwise return sc

  3.add variable 'keepScore' is the same as function score
    - add 'keepScore' 'checkAnswer's properties of variable 'answer' 
    
  4. add 'callBack' function properties of question.prototype.checkAnswer and call callBack(true) next IF syntax.
    - add variable 'sc' above IF syntax
    - fix 'sc' is the same as callBack(true) in IF syntax,
      add 'sc' is the same as callBack(false) in ELSE syntax

  5. display score at Question using prototype
  -declare function, property is score : print "'Your current score is:' + score" to the console


6. call displayScore at Question.prototype.checkAnswer , property is sc
